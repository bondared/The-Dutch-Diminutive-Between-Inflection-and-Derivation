What happens in this chapter?

\section{Discussion of Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the findings make sense within the framework of DM?
\item Discuss other possible interpretations of the results
\end{itemize}
\section{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is not considered in this thesis and why: Inflectional/Derivational entropy measures too hard and fucky to implement, but show pretty robust effects when it comes to predicting lexical decision times (raid the excerpts, but no more!)
\end{itemize}
